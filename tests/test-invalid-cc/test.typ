/// test-invalid-cc
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case that validates the letterloom function properly handles invalid
/// cc parameters by testing various error conditions for the `cc` field.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies and reports errors
/// when cc data is malformed or contains invalid content.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - CC provided as string instead of dictionary
/// - CC dictionary missing required cc-list field
/// - CC list is empty
/// - CC list contains invalid types (numbers, none, empty tuples)
/// - CC label has invalid type
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with clear error messages indicating the specific
/// validation failure for each test case.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "cc must be a dictionary." - when cc is not a dictionary
/// - "cc dictionary must have a cc-list field." - when cc-list field is missing
/// - "cc-list is empty." - when cc-list is empty
/// - "cc recipient 'value' must be a string or content block." - when cc recipient has wrong type
/// - "cc label 'value' must be a string or content block." - when cc label has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the cc validation system properly enforces the requirement
/// that cc data must be properly structured with valid content.
///
/// Note:
/// This test validates that the cc field, which is optional, must be properly
/// formatted when provided.
