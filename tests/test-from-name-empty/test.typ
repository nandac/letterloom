/// Test: Empty From Name
///
/// Purpose:
/// Validates that the letterloom function properly handles cases where
/// the sender's name field is empty or contains no meaningful content.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// 1. From name is an empty string ("")
/// 2. From name is an empty content block ([])
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with a clear error message indicating that
/// the sender's name is empty.
///
/// Expected Error:
/// "panicked with: \"from name is empty.\""
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies empty content
/// in the sender's name field and provides appropriate error feedback.
