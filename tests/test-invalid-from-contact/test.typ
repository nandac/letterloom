/// test-invalid-from-contact
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case that validates the letterloom function properly handles invalid
/// sender contact information by testing various error conditions for the `from` parameter.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies and reports errors
/// when the sender's contact information is missing, malformed, or contains
/// invalid data types.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - Missing `from` parameter entirely
/// - Missing `name` field in from contact dictionary
/// - Empty `name` field (empty string)
/// - Empty `name` field (empty content block)
/// - Invalid `name` field type (number instead of string/content)
/// - Missing `name` field (none value)
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with clear, descriptive error messages indicating
/// the specific validation failure for each test case.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "from is missing." - when from parameter is not provided
/// - "from name is missing." - when name field is not present
/// - "from name is empty." - when name field is empty string or content
/// - "from name must be a string or content block." - when name field has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the contact validation system properly enforces the requirement
/// that sender information must include a valid, non-empty name field.
///
/// Note:
/// This test complements test-invalid-to-contact and validates the same
/// validation logic applied to sender contact information.
