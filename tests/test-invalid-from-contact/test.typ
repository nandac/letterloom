/// test-invalid-from-contact
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case that validates the letterloom function properly handles invalid
/// sender contact parameters by testing type validation and content validation
/// for the `from-name` and `from-address` fields.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies and reports errors
/// when the sender's contact information contains invalid data types, empty values,
/// or missing required fields.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - from-name field is missing (not provided)
/// - from-name field is empty string
/// - from-name field is empty content block
/// - from-name field has invalid type (number instead of string/content)
/// - from-name field has invalid type (none value)
/// - from-name field has invalid type (function result instead of string/content)
/// - from-address field is empty content block
/// - from-address field has invalid type (number instead of string/content)
/// - from-address field has invalid type (none value)
/// - from-address field has invalid type (function result instead of string/content)
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with clear, descriptive error messages indicating
/// the specific validation failure for each test case.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "from-name is missing." - when from-name field is not provided or is none
/// - "from-name is empty." - when from-name field is empty string or content block
/// - "from-name must be a string or content block." - when from-name field has wrong type
/// - "from-address is empty." - when from-address field is empty content block
/// - "from-address must be a string or content block." - when from-address field has wrong type
/// - "from-address is missing." - when from-address field is none
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the contact validation system properly enforces the requirement
/// that sender information must include a valid, non-empty name field and a valid,
/// non-empty address content block. Tests both type validation and content validation.
///
/// Note:
/// This test validates that the from-name and from-address fields, which are required,
/// must be properly formatted and non-empty. It ensures type safety and content validation
/// for sender contact parameters.
