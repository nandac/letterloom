/// Test: Footer Validation
///
/// Purpose:
/// Validates that the letterloom function properly handles various footer
/// validation scenarios including invalid types, structures, and content.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// 1. Footer is provided as a string instead of a dictionary structure
/// 2. Footer dictionary contains an invalid footer-type value
/// 3. Footer dictionary contains invalid footer-text type
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with appropriate error messages for each
/// validation failure scenario.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "panicked with: \"footer element must be a dictionary.\""
/// - "panicked with: \"footer-type must be one of url, email or string.\""
/// - "panicked with: \"footer-text must be a string or content block.\""
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the footer validation system correctly identifies
/// structural and content issues in footer data and provides
/// appropriate error feedback.
