/// test-invalid-date
///
/// Purpose:
/// Validates input validation for the date field in letterloom. Ensures that the function
/// properly handles missing, empty, or incorrectly typed date values and provides
/// appropriate error messages for each validation failure scenario.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - Missing date field (not provided in function call)
/// - Empty date field (empty string)
/// - Empty date field (empty array)
/// - Incorrect date type (number instead of string/content)
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// All test cases should trigger appropriate validation errors when the date field is missing,
/// empty, or of incorrect type. The letterloom function should panic with descriptive error
/// messages indicating the specific validation failure.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "date is missing." - when date field is not provided
/// - "date is empty." - when date field is empty string
/// - "date is empty." - when date field is empty array
/// - "date must be a string or content block." - when date field has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Uses Tytanic's catch() function to capture panics and assert that the expected error
/// messages are returned for each validation scenario.
