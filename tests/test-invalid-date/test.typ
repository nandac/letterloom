/// test-invalid-date
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case that validates the letterloom function properly handles invalid
/// date parameters by testing type validation and content validation
/// for the `date` field.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies and reports errors
/// when the date field is missing, empty, or contains invalid data types.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - Missing date field (not provided in function call)
/// - date field is empty string
/// - date field is empty content block
/// - date field has invalid type (number instead of string/content)
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with clear error messages indicating the specific
/// validation failure for each test case.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "date is missing." - when date field is not provided
/// - "date is empty." - when date field is empty string
/// - "date is empty." - when date field is empty content block
/// - "date must be a string or content block." - when date field has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the date validation system properly enforces the requirement
/// that date information must be a valid, non-empty string or content block.
///
/// Note:
/// This test validates that the date field, which is required for all letters,
/// must be properly formatted and non-empty.
