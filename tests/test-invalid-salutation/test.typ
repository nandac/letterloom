/// test-invalid-salutation
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case for input validation of the salutation field, ensuring proper handling of
/// missing, empty, or incorrectly typed salutation values in letterloom.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Validates input validation for the salutation field in letterloom. Ensures that the function
/// properly handles missing, empty, or incorrectly typed salutation values and provides
/// appropriate error messages for each validation failure scenario.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - Missing salutation field (not provided in function call)
/// - Empty salutation field (empty string)
/// - Empty salutation field (empty array)
/// - Incorrect salutation type (number instead of string/content)
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// All test cases should trigger appropriate validation errors when the salutation field is missing,
/// empty, or of incorrect type. The letterloom function should panic with descriptive error
/// messages indicating the specific validation failure.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "salutation is missing." - when salutation field is not provided
/// - "salutation is empty." - when salutation field is empty string
/// - "salutation is empty." - when salutation field is empty array
/// - "salutation must be a string or content block." - when salutation field has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Uses Tytanic's catch() function to capture panics and assert that the expected error
/// messages are returned for each validation scenario.
