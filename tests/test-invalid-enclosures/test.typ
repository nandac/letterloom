/// test-invalid-enclosures
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case that validates the letterloom function properly handles invalid
/// enclosures parameters by testing various error conditions for the `enclosures` field.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies and reports errors
/// when enclosures data is malformed or contains invalid content.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - Enclosures provided as string instead of dictionary
/// - Enclosures dictionary missing required encl-list field
/// - Enclosures list is empty
/// - Enclosures list contains invalid types (numbers, none, empty tuples)
/// - Enclosures label has invalid type
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with clear error messages indicating the specific
/// validation failure for each test case.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "enclosures must be a dictionary with an encl-list field." - when enclosures is not a dictionary
/// - "enclosures dictionary must have an encl-list field." - when encl-list field is missing
/// - "enclosure encl-list field is empty." - when encl-list is empty
/// - "enclosure 'value' must be a string or content block." - when enclosure item has wrong type
/// - "enclosure label 'value' must be a string or content block." - when enclosure label has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the enclosures validation system properly enforces the requirement
/// that enclosures data must be properly structured with valid content.
///
/// Note:
/// This test validates that the enclosures field, which is optional, must be properly
/// formatted when provided.
