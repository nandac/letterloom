/// test-invalid-closing
///
/// Synopsis:
/// Test case that validates the letterloom function properly handles invalid
/// closing parameters by testing various error conditions for the `closing` field.
///
/// Purpose:
/// Ensures that the validation system correctly identifies and reports errors
/// when the closing field is missing, empty, or contains invalid data types.
///
/// Test Scenarios:
/// - Missing closing field (not provided in function call)
/// - Empty closing field (empty string)
/// - Empty closing field (empty content block)
/// - Incorrect closing type (number instead of string/content)
///
/// Expected Behavior:
/// The function should panic with clear error messages indicating the specific
/// validation failure for each test case.
///
/// Expected Errors:
/// - "closing is missing." - when closing field is not provided
/// - "closing is empty." - when closing field is empty string
/// - "closing is empty." - when closing field is empty content block
/// - "closing must be a string or content block." - when closing field has wrong type
///
/// Validation:
/// Ensures that the closing validation system properly enforces the requirement
/// that closing information must be a valid, non-empty string or content block.
///
/// Note:
/// This test validates that the closing field, which is required for all letters,
/// must be properly formatted and non-empty.
