# The `my-package` Package
<div align="center">Version 0.1.0</div>

A short description about the project and/or client.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on the typst web app. Perhaps a short code example on importing the package and a very simple teaser usage.

```typ
#import "@preview/my-package:0.1.0": *

#show: my-show-rule.with()
#my-func()
```

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running. This should example how to clone the repo and where to (maybe a link to the typst documentation on it), along with any pre-requisite software and installation steps.

```
$ First step
$ Another step
$ Final step
```

## Usage

A more in-depth description of usage. Any template arguments? A complicated example that showcases most if not all of the functions the package provides? This is also an excellent place to signpost the manual.

```typ
#import "@preview/my-package:0.1.0": *

#let my-complicated-example = ...
```
